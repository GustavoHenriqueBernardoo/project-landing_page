This project was one of the most difficult things that I have ever done in my life. Having to create something like this from scratch, alone, It's hard. I stay here sitting in my chair for some hours looking at the blank HTML and CSS and when I start to build everything, one step at a time, everything becomes more clear and easy in my head. As I progress through this project, I realize that I was building this faster than I thought that I would. Please do not get me wrong, I spend more than 4 hours per day on this project, and it was not easy. But I made it! I am going to lie, I got very emotional, seeing the page looking like this. When I finished, I got so proud of myself. I think I deserve it, after doubting too much, after thinking that I wasn't capable, after almost quitting without even trying!

I hope you enjoy it as I did. This was very fun to build and this surprised me a lot! 
anyways, thank you for coming! I wish you a great day and remember... <strong><em>You are capable of anything, my friend.</strong></em> SEE YA!
